# What You'll Learn in This Tutorial


## Why do we want OpenStack HA?


## How does SUSE Cloud do it?

Note: This tutorial is specifically about SUSE Cloud. However, you may
also be interested in a more general, vendor-agnostic overview of HA
in OpenStack Juno and beyond. For that there is an additional talk in
the main conference, **OpenStack High Availability: Are We There
Yet?**, on Wednesday, 1530, in room 252 AB. http://sched.co/1qeP6TX
